Columbia University Module 14 - Tableau Citibike Mapping

## Overview Analysis
We are generating a business proposal for investors in Des Moines, Iowa to use the same CitiBike structure currently in place in New York City. We are taking data from usage in August 2019 in New York to best prepare investors for what a similar initiative would look like in Des Moines. 

## Results

This is a graph depicting the number of trips and the subsequent length that users spent on the CitiBikes. You are also able to filter based on tripduration hours and see how many CitiBike trips were taken that had the same length of time.

This is the same visualization as the previous one, although trip times are broken down by gender. Now we know counts of male/female/unkown trip times and who is more likely to be taking shorter or longer trips.

This is a heatmap depicting the most popular hours (during weekdays) for CitiBike trips to begin. The darker the red in the cell, the more trips were taken during that hour of the weekday.

This is the same visualizaton as the previous one, only with 2 heatmaps depicting the most common weekday hours for CitiBike trips based on gender.

This heatmap depicts which weekdays are the most popular (regradless of hour) among each gender.

This is a map demonstrating the most popular starting points for all CitiBike rides in New York. Darker blues and larger size indicates a higher count of CitiBike rides from that point.

This is a map demonstrating th emost popular ending points for all CitiBike rides in New York. Darker reds and larger sizes indicates a higher count of CitiBike rides ending in that point.

## Summary
Based on the results, we can conclude that the vast majority of CitiBike rides are taken by males for less than 1 hour. The majority of rides are by no surprise taken during rush hour times (Monday - Friday 8 AM and 5 - 6 PM). Both men and women follow similar patterns in terms of when they are most likely to use CitiBikes, but it appears that men are much more likely to use the bikes. Based on the hours of use and trip duration, it would stand to reason that the most common usage of CitiBikes in NYC is for people communiting to and from work.

Two other visualizations that I would recommend would be 1) a breakdown of the costs paid by CitiBike riders per ride and what are the most most profitable hours, days, and/or genders. 2) Much like our checkout times by gender, I think it would be beneficial to see if there is a difference in trip duration based on usertype (who rides more frequently and longer, subscribers or customers?)
