Columbia University Module 14 - Tableau Citibike Mapping

## Overview Analysis
We are generating a business proposal for investors in Des Moines, Iowa to use the same CitiBike structure currently in place in New York City. We are taking data from usage in August 2019 in New York to best prepare investors for what a similar initiative would look like in Des Moines. 

## Results

This is a graph depicting the number of trips and the subsequent length that users spent on the CitiBikes. You are also able to filter based on tripduration hours and see how many CitiBike trips were taken that had the same length of time.

This is the same visualization as the previous one, although trip times are broken down by gender. Now we know counts of male/female/unkown trip times and who is more likely to be taking shorter or longer trips.
